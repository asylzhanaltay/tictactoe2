'''
We have used Claude to get instructions on how to efficiently execute our project idea. 
And we also used CS50 duck to understand certain concepts in the code like jsonify, sessions, etc. 
Claude helped us debug our code â€“ we had a problem of the game not resetting, not ending even if the board is full, also we couldn't understand how to submit the data in web to our code.
It was a really cool experience that helped us learn a lot!
We used it mostly to guide and educated us. So the code was written by us, but AI helped us debug, understand and optimize.
